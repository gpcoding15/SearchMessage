# SearchMessage

This project is a small **React practice exercise** focused on understanding and using **`useState`**, and learning **when `useEffect` is NOT necessary**, following modern React best practices.

---

###  Project Goal

Build a React component that:

- Displays a **text input**
- Stores the user input using **`useState`**
- Shows a **dynamic message** based on the current input value

---

### Business Rules

The message displayed below the input changes according to the input content:

- ✏️ If the input is empty → **"Start typing"**
- ⚠️ If the input has fewer than 3 characters → **"Too short"**
- 🔍 If the input has 3 or more characters → **"Searching..."**
